# WeRateDogs
Masterschool's Project “Wrangle and Analyze Data”
Introduction
Real-world data rarely comes clean. And if we want to get some useful information from big data sets we have to know how to gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. We will take a real data from tweet archive of Twitter user WeRateDogs (@dog_rates), assess its quality and tidiness, clean it and then gather some useful insights.
